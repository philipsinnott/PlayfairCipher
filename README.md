# Playfair Cipher
---
This repository holds my implementation of [Playfair cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher), a manual symmetric encryption technique. I've verified that the code works using (Planetcalc)[https://planetcalc.com/7751/].
## Usage
---
```
git clone https://github.com/philipsinnott/PlayfairCipher.git
cd PlayfairCipher
py main.py
```
